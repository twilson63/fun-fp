# mean

The `mean` function returns the average of all the numbers in an array by adding them together and dividing by the length of the array.  

## Why?

There is no built in JavaScript operator that will return the average, or mean, of a list of numbers.  

# Example

```
const numList = [22, 13, 1, 34, 8]

mean(numList) === 15.6
