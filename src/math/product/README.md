# Product

 The `Product` function allows the user to multiply all values in a list and return the result.

## why?

Having a function that will multiply as many numbers as you want from a number of different sources has a large number of use cases. This gives the user the ability to multiply a long list of numbers that they may not have when the function is created.

## drawbacks

# Example

```
const answer = product([5, 10, 20])
answer === 1000
```
